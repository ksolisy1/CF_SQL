Analysis of a sample database from a fictional movie rental company, 'Rockbuster Stealth,' in PostgreSQL as part of CareerFoundry's Data Analytics Program course requirements. 
## Objective
Rockbuster Stealth is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world, but is now down to just two stores. In order to keep up with the competition from well known streaming services, the Rockbuster management team plans to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service. 

The objective of this project is to provide data-driven answers to business questions brought forward by the Rockbuster Stealth Management Board that they can then use for their 2020 company strategy. 
## Data
The data for this analysis was provided by CareerFoundry but can also be found at the PostgreSQL website [here](www.postgresqltutorial.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dvdrental.zip)

## Results
Currently, Rockbuster's largest customer base is located in India, China, and the United States. In all three of these countries the most lucrative movie categories were sports, animations, and drama.
